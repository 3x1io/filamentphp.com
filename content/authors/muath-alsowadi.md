I am Muath Alsowadi, a Full-Stack Laravel and VueJs Developer based in Sana'a, Yemen. With over 7 years of experience in the industry, I have worked on various open-source projects and have built packages that have been published on NPM and Composer. My expertise lies in Laravel development and DevOps, and I have been involved in projects that are integrated with technologies such as OpenAI.

I believe that flexibility is the key to success in web development, and it's what has allowed me to work with teams from all around the world. Through my programming skills, writing, and presentations, I help people explore their strengths and create their trust in the digital world. My biggest strength is being able to identify skills, gifts, and talents that people don't even realize they have, and I'm always eager to share my knowledge with others.

Currently, I am working as a Laravel Developer at Obeikan Investment Group, where I am involved in projects related to academia and banking systems. I have also worked as a Web Developer at Smart Mind, where I was responsible for developing Laravel projects that integrated with OpenAI. Additionally, I have experience working as a Laravel Developer and DevOps at Benefitsmena.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a focus on Management Information Systems from Sana'a University. In addition, I have completed several online courses and certifications related to my field, including AWS Training & Certification courses on Subnets, Gateways, and Route Tables Explained, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Block Public Access, and Storage Online Course.

I enjoy contributing to the community, and I am an active participant in open-source projects. I am also a certified mentor and have participated in several mentoring programs to help others improve their skills and achieve their goals.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies and exploring new programming languages. I am fluent in Arabic and English, and I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.
